            While community service is not a requirement at Canterbury, the vast
            majority of students choose to participate, often alongside our
            faculty. You can volunteer in food banks, nursing homes, social
            service agencies, and animal shelters or work with disadvantaged
            families, students in local schools, and athletes in the Special
            Olympics. You can also take part in two exceptional experiences
            abroadâ€”one in Nicaragua, where you work on projects designed to help
            break the cycle of poverty, and another in Lourdes, France, where
            you assist the visiting sick in completing their pilgrimage to the
            Marian shrine.
